# SmartCalculator
In this Project I, completely by myself, created a Calculator with GUI.
The Calculator supports trigonometric and all basic math operations (also: sqrt, ln, log, mod).
The Calculator was covered by a big amount of tests (see ./exe/unit_tests.c), what excludes the 99.5% of possible errors.

Works on: MACOS, Linux.
