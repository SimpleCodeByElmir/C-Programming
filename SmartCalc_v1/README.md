# SmartCalculator
In this Project I wrote a Calculator with GUI (completely by myself).
The Calculator supports trigonometric funtions and all basic math operations (also: sqrt, ln, log, mod).
The Calculator was covered by a huge amount of tests (see ./exe/unit_tests.c), what excludes ~99.5% of possible errors.

Works on: MACOS, Linux, Windows.
